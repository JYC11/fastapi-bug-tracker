# TODO:
## short term (set up the messy background stuff)
1. docker-compose file for postgres in github actions workflow
2. github actions workflow CI
3. fake repository and unit of work
4. db integration testing


## priorities
1. user -> use redis for login check?
2. tag -> simplest CRUD
3. bug -> more involved CRUD


## event sourcing
is postgres the best way?
