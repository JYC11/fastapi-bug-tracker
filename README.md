# ABANDONED
## REASON
1. got too similar to my day job of making crud apis
2. got a new job and had to learn a whole buncha stuff
3. accomplished kinda what I wanted to do besides the fancy stuff(starting a project from scratch)
4. realised I need more devops knowledge to accomplish the fancy stuff


# TODO:
## short term (set up the messy background stuff)
1. modelling denormalised tables and event stores for proper Event Sourcing + CQRS
2. re-write orm file
3. fake repository and unit of work


## priorities
1. user -> use redis for login check?
2. tag -> simplest CRUD
3. bug -> more involved CRUD


## event sourcing
is postgres the best way?
